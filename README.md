### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**Ihor-Kon/Ihor-Kon** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨

Python expert. I can transition your idea to a production-ready solution.

I cover the entire development process working on both frontend and backend sides as an individual developer.
I have a really good experience working in team (up to 10 people) as well. Proactivity, communication and development speed are the fundamentals of success.

I have experience in different domains. A few of them are - investment banking, e-commerce, automotive, maps, AI, healthcare, blockchain. Have production experience with most popular python frameworks, such as Django, aiohttp, Flask, Tornado. In my day-to-day work, I mainly use Angular for frontend parts, though I still have experience with pure JS, React, jQuery.
